# validOS - nullOS v2

## What is ValidOS?

ValidOS (or validOS) is a webOS that's built off of anshnk/nullOS. nullOS was dropped since ansh had other projects to work on, but I suppose I'll continue it for fun :)

this repo is continued from lolzthedev/validOS cause i couldnt figure out how to make a pr â˜ 

self-hosting instructions should still work

Self hosing is super simple, just clone the repo!
